# Analysis-of-Heart-Disease
This was my first capstone project from my data science course, in which we learned how to design and evaluate research projects and statistically analyze the results.
In this folder I included:
- **Research proposal:** Here I talk about the importance of understanding the factors that are directly related to heart disease, and the dataset (downloaded from Kaggle) that I used for my analysis. I also posed some questions and hypotheses I wanted to address during this research.
- **Dataset:** data was downloaded from Kaggle. You can also finde it here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaminh/heart-disease-dataset/data](url)
- **Research_Heart_Disease.ipynb:** This is my Jupyter notebook
- **Analysis of Heart Disease Dataset.pdf:** This is the final presentation of my analysis and results.
