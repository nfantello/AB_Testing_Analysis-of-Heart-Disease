# Analysis-of-Heart-Disease
This was my first capstone project from my data science course, in which we learned how to design and evaluate research projects and statistically analyze the results.
In this folder I included:
- **Research proposal:** Here I talk about the importance of understanding the factors that are directly related to heart disease, and the dataset (downloaded from Kaggle) that I used for my analysis. I also posed some questions and hypotheses I wanted to address during this research.
- **Dataset:** data was downloaded from Kaggle. You can also finde it here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaminh/heart-disease-dataset/data](url)
- **Research_Heart_Disease.ipynb:** This is my Jupyter notebook
- **Analysis of Heart Disease Dataset.pdf:** This is the final presentation of my analysis and results. 

## Introduction
Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Heart disease cost the United States about $239.9 billion each year from 2018 to 2019. This includes the cost of healthcare services, medicines, and lost productivity due to death (from CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm).

By analyzing factors that may be associated with heart disease, and how they interact with each other, we can possibly help people/doctors, healthcare providers, government, etc. prevent and/or decrease the number of positive diagnoses of heart disease.

## Questions and Hypotheses
**Questions:**

- Is there any correlation between these factors?
- From these three factors, which one is the one that presents higher correlation with heart disease diagnosis?
- Do patients with heart disease have higher cholesterol than patients without heart disease?
- Do patients with heart disease are older than patients without heart disease?
- Do patients with heart disease have higher max. heart rate than patients without heart disease?
  
**Hypotheses:**

- There is a strong correlation between max heart rate and heart disease diagnosis.
- There is a correlation between age and heart disease diagnosis.
- H0: There is no significant difference between positive and negative heart disease diagnosis for these factors.
- Ha: There is a significant difference between positive and negative heart disease diagnosis for these factors.
